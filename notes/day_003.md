# Day 003 Notes

## Topics Covered
1. if / else (condition checks)
2. Python indentation
3. Comparison (comparator) operators
4. Modulo operator (%)
5. Nesting and `elif`
6. Multiple `if` statements vs `if/elif/else`
7. Python Pizza exercise
8. Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
9. Project: Treasure Island (choose your own adventure)

## 1) if / else
- Use conditionals to control program flow.

Example (concept):
- if condition is true -> run block
- else -> run alternative block

## 2) Indentation
- Indentation defines blocks in Python (child lines belong to parent lines).
- Wrong indentation causes `IndentationError`.

## 3) Comparison Operators
- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `==` equal to
- `!=` not equal to

## 4) Modulo (%)
- Gives remainder after division.
Examples:
- `6 % 2` -> 0
- `6 % 5` -> 1
- `6 % 4` -> 2

Practice:
- `10 % 3` -> 1

Odd/Even logic:
- If `number % 2 == 0` -> Even
- Else -> Odd

## 5) Nesting and elif
- Nesting: if/else inside another if/else.
- `elif` lets you check multiple conditions in order.

Important:
- You can also write an `if` without `else` if you don’t need the false branch.

## 6) Multiple ifs vs if/elif/else
- `if/elif/else`: only one branch runs (mutually exclusive).
- nested ifs: later checks happen only if earlier condition is true.
- multiple ifs: all conditions are checked independently.

## 7) Python Pizza Exercise
Goal: calculate bill based on:
- S: 15, M: 20, L: 25
- Pepperoni: +2 for S, +3 for M/L
- Extra cheese: +1 any size

Learnings:
- Use `if/elif/else` for base price
- Use separate `if` blocks for add-ons

## 8) Logical Operators
- `A and B` -> both must be true
- `C or D` -> any one must be true
- `not E` -> condition must be false

Practice:
- Age 45 to 55 (inclusive) ride free:
  - age >= 45 and age <= 55

## 9) Project: Treasure Island
- Built a choose-your-own-adventure text game using:
  - nested conditionals
  - `elif`
  - logical checks
- Focused on creating suspenseful messages and multiple endings (win/lose).

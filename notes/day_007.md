# Day 007 Notes (Hangman - 5 Steps)

## What I built
- Built the Hangman game step-by-step (Step 1 to Step 5).
- Final version includes:
  - large word list imported from a separate file
  - hangman stages (ASCII art) imported from a separate file
  - logo print at start
  - lives system (6 lives)
  - repeated guesses detection
  - win/lose messages with the actual word on lose

---

## Step 1: Pick a random word + single letter check
Files:
- days/day-007/Step 1/task.py

Key work:
- Selected a random word using `random.choice(word_list)`
- Took user input and converted to lowercase using `.lower()`
- Checked the guessed letter against each character in the word using a for loop

Important learning:
- Looping over a string iterates letter-by-letter.

---

## Step 2: Placeholder + first display rendering
Files:
- days/day-007/Step 2/task.py

Key work:
- Created a placeholder string with underscores (`_`) same length as the chosen word
- Created a `fill_placeholder` output that reveals the guessed letter positions and keeps `_` elsewhere

Important learning:
- Building strings step-by-step with `+=`
- Display logic: if guess matches the current letter -> show letter else show `_`

---

## Step 3: While loop guessing until word complete (two versions)
Files:
- days/day-007/Step 3/task.py
- days/day-007/Step 3/optimised_task.py

Step 3 (original attempt):
- Used `while display != chosen_word` to keep guessing
- Tried to keep previous correct letters using string slicing and a `letter_count` approach

Issues discovered (important learning):
- You cannot do: `for i, letter in chosen_word` (needs `enumerate`)
- Strings cannot be updated using `display[i] = ...` because strings are immutable

Step 3 (optimised_task.py):
- Switched `display` to a list of underscores
- Updated list positions when a guessed letter matches
- Loop continues while "_" exists in display

Important learning:
- `enumerate()` gives (index, value) when iterating
- Use a list when you need to update characters by index

---

## Step 4: Add lives + stages (ASCII art) + correct letters tracking
Files:
- days/day-007/Step 4/task.py

Key work:
- Added `lives = 6`
- Added `stages` list (ASCII art) and printed the stage based on remaining lives
- Added `correct_letters` list to remember correct guesses
- If guess is wrong: reduce lives
- End conditions:
  - no lives -> lose
  - no underscores left -> win

Important learning:
- Using a list to store past correct guesses
- Using conditions to control game flow
- Printing UI based on game state (`stages[lives]`)

---

## Step 5: Final Hangman with separate modules + improved UX
Files:
- days/day-007/Step 5/task.py
- days/day-007/Step 5/hangman_words.py
- days/day-007/Step 5/hangman_art.py

Key work:
- Imported the full word list:
  - `from hangman_words import word_list`
- Imported stages + logo:
  - `from hangman_art import stages, logo`
- Printed logo at the start
- Printed lives remaining each round
- Added repeated guess warning:
  - If guess already in `correct_letters`, print "You've already guessed ..."
- Added wrong guess message + life loss message:
  - "You guessed X, that's not in the word. You lose a life."
- On lose:
  - Prints the correct word: `IT WAS <chosen_word>`

Important learning:
- Splitting code into files/modules for cleaner structure
- Better game feedback improves user experience

---

## Key Concepts Used
- `random.choice()`
- `for` loops over strings
- `while` loop for repeated guessing
- `.lower()` for consistent input
- lists for tracking (`correct_letters`, `stages`)
- indexing (`stages[lives]`)
- `enumerate()` (index + character)

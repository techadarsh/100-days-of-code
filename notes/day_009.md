# Day 009 Notes

## Topics Covered
- Dictionaries (create, read, update, loop)
- Nesting (list inside dictionary, list inside list, dictionary inside dictionary)
- Project: Blind Auction (bids stored in a dictionary + find highest bidder)

---

## 1) Dictionaries (Basics)
File:
- day-009/Dictionaries/task.py

What I practiced:
- Created a dictionary with key-value pairs.
- Accessed values using keys.
- Updated an existing key’s value.
- Created an empty dictionary.
- Looped through a dictionary to print keys and values.

Key examples used:
- programming_dictionary["Bug"]
- programming_dictionary["Loop"] = "Updated entry"
- for key in programming_dictionary: print(key), print(programming_dictionary[key])

Key takeaways:
- Dictionaries store data as {key: value}
- Keys are used to retrieve values.
- Looping over a dictionary gives keys by default.

## 2) Nested Lists and Dictionaries
File:
- day-009/Nested Lists and Dictionaries/task.py

What I practiced:
- Nested list inside a dictionary:
  travel_log = {
    "France": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"],
    "Germany": ["Berlin", "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"]
  }

- Printed a specific nested value:
  - "Lille" using: travel_log["France"][1]

- Nested list inside a list:
  nested_list = ["A", "B", ["C", "D"]]
  - Printed "D" using: nested_list[2][1]

- Dictionary inside a dictionary:
  travel_log_version_2 = {
    "Germany": {
      "num_times_visited": 5,
      "cities_visited": ["Berlin", "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"]
    }
  }

- Printed "Stuttgart" using:
  travel_log_version_2["Germany"]["cities_visited"][2]

Key takeaways:
- Combine list/dict to build structured data.
- Access nested data by chaining keys and indexes.

## 3) Project: Blind Auction
Files:
- day-009/Blind Auction Project/task.py
- day-009/Blind Auction Project/art.py

Goal:
- Take multiple bids without showing previous bids (blind bidding).
- Store bids in a dictionary:
  bids[name] = bid_amount
- Ask if there are more bidders.
- Clear the screen output by printing many blank lines.
- Find and print the highest bidder and bid.

What I implemented:
- Printed logo from art.py at the start of bidding.
- Used a while loop to keep taking bids until user says "no".
- Stored each bidder’s name and bid amount in a dictionary.
- Used:
  max_item = max(bids, key=bids.get)
  to find the winner based on highest bid.
- Printed winner with the amount.

Key takeaways:
- Dictionaries are perfect for mapping people to values (name -> bid).
- while loops + dictionaries can handle repeated user inputs.
- max(..., key=...) is a clean way to find the highest value in a dictionary.

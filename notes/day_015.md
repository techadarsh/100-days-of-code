# Day 015 Notes

## Project: Coffee Machine

## What I built
- Built a Coffee Machine program that can:
  - take user orders (espresso/latte/cappuccino)
  - check resources (water/milk/coffee)
  - accept coins and validate payment
  - give change (rounded to 2 decimals)
  - update profit (money)
  - deduct ingredients and “dispense” coffee with ASCII art
  - show a report of current resources
  - maintenance mode to refill resources
  - turn off using the secret command "off"

Files used (day-015/Coffee Machine Project):
- main.py (main working program)
- task.py (requirements + implementation)
- art.py (ASCII art for coffee types / cup)

---

## Key Concepts Used
- Dictionaries (nested dict for MENU + resources)
- while loop (machine runs continuously until "off")
- Functions (separate responsibilities)
- Conditional logic (if/elif/else for commands and drink selection)
- Input handling + simple calculations
- f-strings and rounding to 2 decimals (change handling)
- getattr() to print correct ASCII art dynamically

---

## Data Structures
### MENU (drink recipes + cost)
- MENU stores:
  - ingredients required for each drink
  - cost of each drink

Example structure:
- MENU["latte"]["ingredients"]["milk"] -> 150
- MENU["espresso"]["cost"] -> 1.5

### resources (machine inventory)
- water (ml)
- milk (ml)
- coffee (g)
- money ($)

---

## Program Commands
- "espresso" / "latte" / "cappuccino" -> place an order
- "report" -> prints current resources + money
- "maintenance" -> refill resources (water/milk/coffee)
- "off" -> stop the machine

---

## Functions Implemented
- ask_user()
  - prompts: "What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):"
- turn_off_machine()
  - sets machine_working = False
- print_report()
  - prints Water/Milk/Coffee/Money
- check_resources(coffee_type)
  - checks if resources are enough for selected coffee
- update_resources()
  - adds inventory during maintenance
- process_coin(coffee_type)
  - takes quarters/dimes/nickles/pennies
  - calculates total inserted
  - checks if payment is sufficient
  - adds profit and returns change
- make_coffee(coffee_type)
  - deducts required ingredients from resources
  - prints coffee ASCII art and final message

---

## Keywords / Commands
The coffee machine keeps asking:
"What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):"

You can type any of these keywords:

- **espresso**
  - Checks resources for espresso
  - Asks for coins
  - If payment is enough: deducts ingredients, adds money, and dispenses espresso

- **latte**
  - Checks resources for latte
  - Asks for coins
  - If payment is enough: deducts ingredients, adds money, and dispenses latte

- **cappuccino**
  - Checks resources for cappuccino
  - Asks for coins
  - If payment is enough: deducts ingredients, adds money, and dispenses cappuccino

- **report**
  - Prints the current machine status:
    - Water: ___ml
    - Milk: ___ml
    - Coffee: ___g
    - Money: $___

- **maintenance**
  - Maintenance/refill mode
  - Adds stock back into the machine (water/milk/coffee)
  - After refill, the machine continues normally and prompts again

- **off**
  - Secret keyword for maintainers
  - Turns off the machine and ends the program immediately

- **anything else**
  - Prints an invalid input message and shows the prompt again

---

## ASCII Art Printing
- Used getattr to display coffee art based on the selected drink name:
  - getattr(art, coffee_type, art.cup)
So if coffee_type = "latte", it prints art.latte (if available), otherwise art.cup.

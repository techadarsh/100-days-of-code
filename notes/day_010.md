# Day 010 Notes

## Topics Covered
- Functions with outputs (`return`)
- Difference between `print` and `return`
- Multiple return statements (conditional returns)
- Early exit / empty return
- Docstrings for documenting functions
- Project: Calculator (operations via functions + operation mapping using a dictionary)

---

## 1) Functions with Outputs
Files:
- day-010/Functions with Outputs/task.py

What I practiced:
- Created functions that return a value instead of only printing.
- Built `format_name(f_name, l_name)` that formats names using `.title()` and returns the result.

Key takeaway:
- `return` gives back a value you can store and reuse.
- `print` only displays output, it does not return a value.

## 2) Multiple Return Values (Conditional Returns)
Files:
- day-010/Multiple Return Values/task.py

What I practiced:
- Added input validation in `format_name()`:
  - If first name or last name is empty, return a message like "Enter Your Full Name".
  - Else return the formatted full name.
- Learned that once `return` runs, the function stops (nothing below it executes).

Key takeaway:
- Multiple returns are useful when different conditions need different exits/results.

---

## 3) Docstrings
Files:
- day-010/Docstrings/task.py

What I practiced:
- Added a docstring inside `format_name()` to describe:
  - what the function does
  - parameters
  - return value
- Understood that docstrings help when you hover a function / read code later.

Key takeaway:
- Docstrings improve code readability and act like built-in documentation.

## 4) Project: Calculator
Files:
- day-010/Calculator Project/task.py
- day-010/Calculator Project/art.py

What I built:
- Calculator that supports: +, -, *, /
- Separate functions for each operation:
  - add, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Two approaches to run operations:
  1) using if/elif (`calculate_by_if_condition`)
  2) using a dictionary that maps operators to functions:
     operation_dictionary = { "+": add, "-": subtraction, "*": multiplication, "/": division }

Program flow:
- Ask first number (or reuse previous result if continuing)
- Ask operator
- Ask next number
- Compute result using function mapping
- Ask user:
  - 'y' to continue with current result
  - 'n' to start a new calculation (reset result)
  - 'c' to close calculator

Key takeaways:
- Function mapping via dictionary is clean and scalable.
- Reusing `final_result` makes the calculator interactive and user-friendly.

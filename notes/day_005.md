# Day 005 Notes

## Topics Covered
- For loops (iterating over a list)
- `range()` for looping over numbers
- Accumulator pattern (sum / total)
- Finding highest value using a loop
- Project: Password Generator

## For Loops
- A `for` loop repeats code for each item in a sequence (like a list).

Concept:
- `for item in list_name:`
  - indented code runs once per item

## `range()` Function
- `range(a, b)` generates numbers from a to (b - 1)
- `range(a, b, step)` increments by `step`

Examples:
- `range(1, 11)` -> 1 to 10
- `range(0, 101, 2)` -> even numbers up to 100

## Accumulator Pattern (Total / Sum)
- Start with a variable like `total = 0`
- Add values inside the loop:
  - `total += value`

Used for:
- total score
- sum of numbers
- calculating results step-by-step

## Finding Highest Score (Loop Method)
- Start with `highest = 0` (or the first element of the list)
- Compare each number and update if bigger:
  - `if score > highest: highest = score`

This is the loop-based way (instead of using `max()`).

## Project: Password Generator
Goal:
- Ask the user:
  - How many letters?
  - How many symbols?
  - How many numbers?
- Generate a password using random characters.

Key ideas used:
- Store characters in lists (letters, numbers, symbols)
- Use random selection from a list
- Use loops to pick required counts and build the password

Easy Version:
- Build password in sequence:
  - letters -> symbols -> numbers

Hard Version:
- Mix (shuffle) the final password so it does not follow a fixed pattern
- Output as a single string

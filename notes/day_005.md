# Day 005 Notes

## Topics Covered
- For loops in Python
- Indentation inside loops
- Using `range()` for sequences of numbers
- Summing numbers with an accumulator variable
- Mini challenge: Gauss sum (1 to 100)
- Project/Exercise: FizzBuzz

## For Loop Basics
- A for loop repeats an action for each item in a sequence (like a list).

Example idea:
- Loop through a list of fruits and print each fruit.
- Indentation controls what runs inside the loop.

Key point:
- Everything indented under the `for ...:` line is part of the loop body.

## `range()` Function
- `range(start, end)` includes `start` but does NOT include `end`.
  - Example: `range(1, 10)` gives 1 to 9
- `range(start, end, step)` uses `step` as the increment.
  - Example: `range(1, 10, 2)` gives 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

## Accumulator Pattern (Total / Sum)
- Use a variable to keep adding values inside a loop.

Example concept:
- Start with `total_sum = 0`
- Add each number to total inside loop:
  - `total_sum += i`

## Gauss Challenge (1 to 100)
Goal:
- Sum all numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop and `total_sum`.

## FizzBuzz
Rules (for 1 to 100):
- If number divisible by both 3 and 5 -> print "FizzBuzz"
- Else if divisible by 3 -> print "Fizz"
- Else if divisible by 5 -> print "Buzz"
- Else print the number

Important condition order:
- Check "both 3 and 5" first (i%3==0 and i%5==0)
- Then check 3 and 5 separately

## Functions
- A function is a reusable block of code that performs a task.
- Helps reduce repetition and makes code more readable.

Concept:
- Define a function:
  - def function_name():
      code...
- Call a function:
  - function_name()

Why functions help:
- Write once, use many times
- Easier debugging
- Cleaner logic

## While Loop
- A while loop keeps running as long as a condition is true.

Concept:
- while condition_is_true:
    do something

Important points:
- Make sure the condition eventually becomes false, otherwise it becomes an infinite loop.
- Use while loops when you don't know in advance how many times you must repeat something.

## Reeborg's World Challenges Solved
### Hurdle Series
- Hurdle 1
- Hurdle 2
- Hurdle 3
- Hurdle 4

Learnings:
- Use functions like jump() to avoid repeating code.
- Use loops to repeat actions until the goal is reached.
- Use conditions to decide when to jump vs move.

### Maze
Learnings:
- Use logical decisions to find a path.
- Repeat until goal is reached.
- Try a consistent rule (example: keep checking available paths) to avoid getting stuck.

### Rain Series
- Rain 1
- Rain 2
- Rain 3

Learnings:
- Use while loops to keep moving until a condition changes.
- Use conditions to handle obstacles and different paths.

## Key Takeaways
- Functions make repeated steps easy and clean.
- While loops are powerful for unknown number of repetitions.
- Combining conditions + loops is the core of solving maze/hurdle style problems.

# Day 018 Notes

## Topic: Turtle Graphics + GUI Programs (Turtle) + Hirst Painting Project

Today I practiced drawing with Python’s `turtle` module and built a Hirst-style dot painting using RGB colors.

Project files (from today’s zip):
- day-018/main.py
- day-018/hirst-painting-project/main.py
- day-018/hirst-painting-project/hirst-painting.webp

## 1) Turtle Basics (movement + shape + color)
File:
- day-018/main.py

What I used:
- `from turtle import Turtle, Screen`
- Created turtle objects using:
  - `timmy_turtle = Turtle()`
- Set appearance:
  - `.shape("turtle")`
  - `.color("red")`
- Movement:
  - `.left(angle)`, `.right(angle)`
  - `.forward(distance)`

---

## 2) Challenge 1: Draw a Square
- Used a loop to draw 4 sides:
  - move forward
  - turn right 90 degrees

Key concept:
- Repeating patterns with `for` loops.

---

## 3) Notes on Imports + Aliases + External Packages
In the same file, I noted different import styles:
- `import turtle`
- `from turtle import Turtle, Screen`
- `from turtle import *` (not recommended generally)

Aliasing:
- `import turtle as t`

External package practice:
- Imported `heroes` and printed a random generated name:
  - `import heroes as h`
  - `print(h.gen())`

---

## 4) Challenge 2: Draw a Dashed Line
- Used pen control methods:
  - `.penup()` to lift pen (move without drawing)
  - `.pendown()` to draw again
- Loop pattern:
  - forward 10 (draw)
  - pen up + forward 10 (gap)
  - pen down

---

## 5) Challenge 3: Draw Different Shapes (Triangle to Decagon)
- Used nested loops:
  - Outer loop: number of sides from 3 to 10
  - Inner loop: draw each side
- Turn angle formula:
  - `360 / number_of_sides`
- Random colors:
  - `random.choice(colors)`
- Speed:
  - `.speed("fastest")` for faster drawing

---

## 6) Challenge 4 (commented): Random Walk (planned)
- A random walk idea was started but commented.
- Plan was to use:
  - fixed direction headings: `[0, 90, 180, 270]`
  - random color selection
  - thicker pen size: `.pensize(15)`
- Mentioned the next learning goal:
  - use tuples + random RGB generation

---

## 7) Hirst Painting Project (Dot Painting Grid)
File:
- day-018/hirst-painting-project/main.py

Goal:
- Create a 10x10 dot painting using random colors (Hirst-style).

### A) Color extraction (commented)
- `colorgram` extraction is present but commented:
  - Intended to extract 30 colors from `hirst-painting.webp`
  - Build a list of RGB tuples

### B) RGB color mode + dot painting
- Used turtle alias:
  - `import turtle as t`
- Enabled RGB mode:
  - `t.colormode(255)`
- Prepared turtle:
  - `tim.penup()`
  - `tim.hideturtle()`
  - `tim.speed("fastest")`

### C) Starting position + grid logic
- Moved turtle to bottom-left starting position:
  - set heading 225, move forward, then face 0 degrees
- Painted 100 dots:
  - `tim.dot(20, random.choice(rgb_color_list))`
  - move forward 50 between dots
- New row logic (every 10 dots):
  - turn up, move 50
  - turn back, move 500
  - face right again

### D) Screen
- Used:
  - `screen.exitonclick()` to keep window open until click

## Key Takeaways
- Turtle graphics uses objects (turtles) and methods for movement and drawing.
- `penup()` / `pendown()` controls whether movement draws lines.
- Random colors can be chosen from a list (or generated via RGB).
- Using `colormode(255)` allows real RGB tuples in Turtle.
- Grid drawings become simple with a counter + modulus check (`% 10`).

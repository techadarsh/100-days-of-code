# Day 019 Notes

## Topic: Turtle Event Listeners + Higher Order Functions + Mini Projects

Today I worked with Turtle GUI input handling using keyboard events, and built two mini projects:
1) Etch-A-Sketch app (keyboard controlled drawing)
2) Turtle Race game (user bet + random race)

Project files (from today’s zip):
- day-019/Higher Order Functions & Event Listners/main.py
- day-019/Challenge: Make an Etch-A-Sketch App/main.py
- day-019/Turtle Race Project App/main.py

## 1) Higher Order Functions & Event Listeners (Turtle)
File:
- day-019/Higher Order Functions & Event Listners/main.py

What I learned:
- A **higher order function** is a function that can take another function as an input (argument).
- Turtle uses event listeners to connect key presses to functions.

Key methods:
- `screen.listen()`
  - Enables the screen to listen for keyboard events.
- `screen.onkey(fun=some_function, key="space")`
  - Runs the function when the key is pressed.
  - Important: you pass the function name WITHOUT brackets.
    - Correct: `screen.onkey(move_forward, "space")`
    - Wrong: `screen.onkey(move_forward(), "space")` (this would call it immediately)

In this file:
- Pressing **space** moves the turtle forward by 10 using `tim.forward(10)`.

## 2) Etch-A-Sketch App (Keyboard Controlled Drawing)
File:
- day-019/Challenge: Make an Etch-A-Sketch App/main.py

Goal:
- Control the turtle like an Etch-A-Sketch using arrow keys.
- Add a clear/reset feature.

Controls implemented:
- **Up**: move forward (`tim.forward(10)`)
- **Down**: move backward (`tim.backward(10)`)
- **Left**: rotate left by 10 degrees
  - Used `tim.heading()` to get current direction
  - Used `tim.setheading(new_heading)` to update direction
- **Right**: rotate right by 10 degrees
- **c**: clear the screen and reset turtle position

Clear/reset logic:
- `tim.clear()` clears the drawing.
- `tim.penup()` lifts pen so moving doesn't draw.
- `tim.home()` returns turtle to the center (0,0) facing default direction.
- `tim.pendown()` enables drawing again.

Key takeaway:
- Event-driven programming: no "while loop" needed.
- Program stays alive using `screen.exitonclick()` and reacts to key presses.

## 3) Turtle Race Project (User Bet + Random Movement)
File:
- day-019/Turtle Race Project App/main.py

Goal:
- Let the user bet on a turtle color.
- Move turtles randomly until one reaches the finish line.
- Announce win/lose based on the user's bet.

Screen setup:
- `screen.setup(width=800, height=600)`
- `screen.textinput(title=..., prompt=...)` to take the user's bet.

Turtles setup:
- Created 7 turtles with different colors:
  - ["purple", "indigo", "blue", "green", "yellow", "orange", "red"]
- Stored turtles in a dictionary:
  - key like `"blue-timmy"`
  - value is the Turtle object

Placing turtles:
- All turtles start at x = -350
- y starts at 150 and decreases by 50 for each turtle (so they line up)

Race loop:
- If user entered a bet, start race.
- Each turtle moves a random distance each round:
  - `forward(random.randint(0, 10))`

Finish condition:
- If turtle’s `xcor()` goes beyond 350, race ends.
- Winner color extracted from dictionary key:
  - `winning_color = turtle.split("-")[0]`

Result:
- If winning_color == user_bat -> user wins
- else -> user loses

Key takeaway:
- Using `.xcor()` helps detect finish line crossing.
- Dictionaries can store multiple turtle objects cleanly.
- Random steps make the race unpredictable.

---

## Summary
- Learned event-driven Turtle programming using `listen()` + `onkey()`.
- Understood higher order functions: passing a function into another function.
- Built an interactive Etch-A-Sketch with keyboard controls + reset.
- Built a Turtle Race game with user betting + random movement + winner detection.

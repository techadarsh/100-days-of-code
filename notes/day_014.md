# Day 014 Notes

## Project: Higher Lower Game (Instagram Followers)

## What I built
- Built the Higher Lower game where the player guesses who has more followers.
- Uses game data from `game_data.py` and ASCII art from `art.py`.
- Tracks score and continues until the player makes a wrong guess.

Files used:
- task.py (main game logic)
- game_data.py (list of accounts with follower data)
- art.py (logo + vs art)

---

## Key Concepts Used (based on what I’ve learned so far)
- Functions (with inputs + return outputs)
- While loops (game loop until wrong answer)
- Random selection using `random.choice()`
- Dictionaries (account objects with keys like name, description, country, follower_count)
- Input validation (only accept 'a' or 'b')
- Formatting output using f-strings
- Basic scope/clean structure (no global state needed)

---

## Program Flow
1. Start game and set `score = 0`.
2. Randomly pick two different accounts: `account_a` and `account_b`.
3. Show:
   - Logo
   - Current score (after the first correct answer)
   - Compare A details
   - VS art
   - Compare B details
4. Calculate correct answer:
   - If `A.follower_count > B.follower_count` → correct is 'a'
   - Else → correct is 'b'
5. Ask user for guess and validate input.
6. If guess is correct:
   - Increase score
   - Move `account_b` into `account_a`
   - Pick a new random `account_b` (ensure it’s not the same as `account_a`)
7. If guess is wrong:
   - Print final score
   - End game

## Functions I Used
- `clear_screen()`  
  Prints blank lines to simulate clearing the console.
- `format_account(account)`  
  Creates a readable string: name + description + country.
- `get_random_account()`  
  Returns one random account from the dataset.
- `get_correct_answer(a, b)`  
  Returns `'a'` or `'b'` based on follower_count comparison.
- `get_valid_guess()`  
  Re-prompts user until input is 'a' or 'b'.
- `play_game()`  
  Main game loop.

# Day 011 Notes

## Project: Blackjack (House Rules Version)

## What I built
- Built a playable Blackjack game (user vs computer dealer).
- Uses an unlimited deck (cards are not removed when drawn).
- Added ASCII card art and prints multiple cards horizontally in the terminal.
- Implemented replay (restart) option and clears the console between games.

Repo files (day-011/Blackjack Project):
- task.py (main game)
- art.py (logo + card ASCII art + card back)
- direction.md (project guide + requirements + hints)

---

## House Rules Implemented
- Deck is unlimited.
- No jokers.
- J, Q, K count as 10.
- Ace counts as 11 or 1 (auto-adjust if total > 21).
- Dealer draws until score >= 17.
- Blackjack (Ace + 10 as first 2 cards) is represented as score 0.

## Key Concepts Used
- Functions:
  - deal_card()
  - calculate_score()
  - compare()
  - play_game()
  - print_cards_horizontal()
  - get_ascii_art_of_card()
- Lists:
  - user_cards, computer_cards
  - storing cards and appending new draws
- While loops:
  - main gameplay loop (hit/stand)
  - dealer drawing loop (until 17)
  - restart loop (play again)
- Conditionals:
  - blackjack detection
  - bust detection
  - comparing final results
- Randomisation:
  - random.choice() for drawing cards and picking card art ranks for 10-value cards

## Gameplay Flow
1. Start a new game and deal 2 cards to user and dealer.
2. Show:
   - user’s full hand (values + ASCII cards)
   - dealer’s first card only (2nd card hidden using CARD_BACK)
3. User chooses:
   - 'y' to draw another card
   - 'n' to pass
4. Game ends immediately if:
   - user has blackjack (score 0)
   - dealer has blackjack (score 0)
   - user busts (score > 21)
5. Dealer draws cards while dealer score < 17.
6. Show final hands and scores for both user and dealer.
7. Print result using compare(user_score, computer_score).
8. Ask to play again. If yes:
   - clear console
   - restart the game

---

## Important Implementation Notes
- Blackjack check:
  - if sum(cards) == 21 and len(cards) == 2 -> return 0
- Ace adjustment:
  - if 11 in cards and sum(cards) > 21 -> replace one 11 with 1
- Dealer hidden card:
  - show only dealer’s first card and a CARD_BACK during user turn
  - reveal full dealer hand at the end

---

## Terminal Output Improvements
- Implemented horizontal printing for multiple cards:
  - split each card’s ASCII into lines
  - pad each line to equal width (ljust)
  - print line-by-line with a gap between cards

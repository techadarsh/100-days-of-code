# Day 017 Notes

## Topic: OOP Basics + Quiz Game (True/False)

Today I practiced Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals (classes, objects, attributes, methods, constructors) and built a simple True/False Quiz Game using multiple Python files.

Folder structure (from today’s work):
- day-017/Creating Classes/main.py
- day-017/Attributes, Class, Constructors and the __init__() Functions/main.py
- day-017/Quiz Game/
  - main.py
  - question_model.py
  - quiz_brain.py
  - opentdb_data.py
  - data.py (alternate dataset)

---

## 1) Creating a basic class and objects
File:
- day-017/Creating Classes/main.py

What I did:
- Created a class:

  class User:
      pass

- Created objects (instances):
  user_1 = User()
  user_2 = User()

- Added attributes to objects after creating them:
  user_1.id = "001"
  user_1.username = "adarsharma"

Key takeaway:
- A class is a blueprint.
- An object is a real instance created from the class.
- In this first example, attributes were attached manually after object creation.

---

## 2) Constructors and default attributes using __init__()
File:
- day-017/Attributes, Class, Constructors and the __init__() Functions/main.py

What I did:
- Used a constructor to set attributes at creation time:

  def __init__(self, id, username, password):
      self.id = id
      self.username = username
      self.password = password
      self.followers = 0
      self.following = 0

- Created users like:
  user_1 = User("001", "adarsharma", "adarsharma")
  user_2 = User("002", "adarsharmaec007", "adarsharmaec007")

Why this is better than setting attributes manually:
- Every user object will always have the required attributes.
- Default values (followers/following) are set automatically.

### Method example: follow()
- I added a method that updates both users’ stats:

  def follow(self, user):
      user.followers += 1
      self.following += 1

Example:
- user_1.follow(user_2)
  - user_2.followers increases by 1
  - user_1.following increases by 1

Key takeaway:
- Methods are functions that belong to a class and operate on object data.
- self refers to the current object calling the method.

## 3) Quiz Game Project (modular OOP)
Project folder:
- day-017/Quiz Game/

Goal:
- Build a True/False quiz where:
  - questions are stored as objects
  - QuizBrain controls the quiz flow and scoring

### A) Question model (Question class)
File:
- day-017/Quiz Game/question_model.py

Class:
- Question(text, answer)

Constructor:
- Stores:
  - self.text
  - self.answer

So each question becomes an object like:
- Question("Africa is a country.", "False")

Key takeaway:
- Question class is the data structure for one question.

### B) QuizBrain (controls logic + scoring)
File:
- day-017/Quiz Game/quiz_brain.py

Attributes in QuizBrain:
- self.question_number (tracks current index)
- self.questions_list (list of Question objects)
- self.score (tracks correct answers)

Methods:
1) still_has_questions()
- returns True if there are more questions left:

  return self.question_number < len(self.questions_list)

2) next_question()
- reads current question object from the list
- asks user input (True/False)
- increments question number
- calls check_answer()

3) check_answer(u_ans, c_ans)
- compares user answer with correct answer
- updates score
- prints feedback and the correct answer

Key takeaway:
- QuizBrain separates “game logic” from “question data”.

### C) Main program (build question bank + run quiz)
File:
- day-017/Quiz Game/main.py

Steps:
1) Import:
- Question
- question_data
- QuizBrain

2) Build question_bank list:
- Loop through question_data
- Create a Question object for each item
- Append to question_bank

3) Create QuizBrain object:
- qb = QuizBrain(question_bank)

4) Run quiz loop:
- while qb.still_has_questions():
    qb.next_question()

5) Print final score:
- qb.score / len(question_bank)

Key takeaway:
- main.py is the controller:
  - builds data objects
  - starts the quiz loop
  - prints final results

### D) Data sources
Files:
- day-017/Quiz Game/opentdb_data.py
  - question_data as a list of dictionaries using keys:
    - "question"
    - "correct_answer"

- day-017/Quiz Game/data.py
  - alternate dataset using keys:
    - "text"
    - "answer"

Important note:
- If switching datasets, you must adjust key names in main.py.

## Summary of what I learned
- Class = blueprint, Object = instance.
- Attributes store data inside an object.
- Methods define behavior/actions for an object.
- __init__() constructor sets required attributes and defaults.
- Splitting code into multiple files (Question model + QuizBrain + main) makes the project cleaner and easier to extend.

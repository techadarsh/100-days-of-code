# Day 012 Notes

## Topics Covered
- Namespaces & Scope
  - Local scope (function scope)
  - Global scope
  - No block scope in Python
- Global variables and the `global` keyword
- Python constants (ALL_CAPS convention)
- Project: Number Guessing Game (easy/medium/hard difficulty)

---

## 1) Namespaces and Scope
File:
- day-012/Namespaces and Scope/task.py

Key points:
- Variables declared inside a function have local scope and cannot be accessed outside the function.
- Variables declared at the top level of a file have global scope and can be accessed anywhere in the file.
- Local scope is limited to the function block where it was created.

---

## 2) Block Scope (Python does NOT have it)
File:
- day-012/Block Scope/task.py

Key points:
- Python does not have block scope like some other languages.
- Variables created inside `if`, `for`, `while` blocks are still accessible in the same function/file scope.
- Scope is mainly:
  - function scope (inside def)
  - global scope (outside def)

---

## 3) Global Variables
File:
- day-012/Global Vars/task.py

Key points:
- If you try to modify a global variable inside a function without `global`, it causes an error.
- Using `global variable_name` inside a function allows modifying the global variable.

Example concept:
- enemies = 5
- def increase_enemies():
    global enemies
    enemies += 1

Note:
- Avoid using global variables too much; it can make code harder to debug.

---

## 4) Python Constants & Global Scope
File:
- day-012/Python Constants & Global Scope/task.py

Key points:
- Constants are values meant to be "set and forget".
- Naming convention: ALL_CAPS with underscores.
Examples:
- PI = 3.14159
- GOOGLE_URL = "https://www.google.com"

---

## 5) Project: Number Guessing Game
Files:
- day-012/Number Guessing Project/task.py
- day-012/Number Guessing Project/art.py

What I built:
- A guessing game where the computer selects a random number and the user tries to guess it.
- Difficulty levels control attempts:
  - easy: 15 attempts
  - medium: 10 attempts
  - hard: 5 attempts
- Game uses a loop to continue until:
  - user guesses correctly, or
  - attempts reach 0

Core logic used:
- random number generation:
  - random.randint(1, 100)
- difficulty mapping using a dictionary:
  - game_level_dist = {"easy": 15, "medium": 10, "hard": 5}
- comparisons:
  - if guess > number: "too high"
  - if guess < number: "too low"
  - else correct
- attempts decrement each wrong guess
- ASCII logo displayed using art.py

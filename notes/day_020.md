## Project: Snake Game (Part 1)

Today I started building the Snake game using Turtle graphics. The focus was on:
- Creating the snake body
- Moving the snake smoothly
- Controlling direction using keyboard events
- Using OOP to keep the code clean (Snake class)

Project files:
- day-020/Snake Game Part 1/main.py
- day-020/Snake Game Part 1/snake.py
- day-020/Snake Game Part 1/task.py

## 1) Screen setup (main.py)
- Created a Turtle Screen:
  - screen.setup(width=600, height=600)
  - screen.bgcolor("black")
  - screen.title("Snack Game Part 1")
- Used a game loop with:
  - time.sleep(0.15)
  - snake.move()

Key takeaway:
- Turtle animation looks smooth when you move the snake in a loop with a small sleep delay.

---

## 2) Using OOP: Snake class (snake.py)
### Why a class here?
Instead of keeping multiple segment turtles in one big file, I created a Snake class to manage:
- snake segments list
- snake head
- movement logic
- direction controls

### Attributes used
- self.segments
  - list of Turtle objects (each Turtle is one snake block)
- self.head
  - first segment (self.segments[0]) used for heading and forward movement

### Constants (readability + control)
- STARTING_POSITION = [(0, 0), (-20, 0), (-40, 0)]
- MOVE_DISTANCE = 20
- UP = 90, DOWN = 270, LEFT = 180, RIGHT = 0

Key takeaway:
- Using constants makes movement and directions easier to control and avoids magic numbers.

---

## 3) Creating the snake body (create_snake)
Method:
- create_snake()

Logic:
- Loop through STARTING_POSITION
- For each position:
  - create a Turtle square segment
  - set color white
  - penup() to prevent drawing lines
  - goto(position)
  - append to self.segments

Key takeaway:
- Each snake block is a separate Turtle object stored inside a list.

---

## 4) Moving the snake (move)
Method:
- move()

Logic:
- Move from the last segment to the first (reverse loop):
  - each segment copies the coordinates of the segment in front of it
- Finally move the head forward by MOVE_DISTANCE

Key takeaway:
- Reverse loop is important so you don’t overwrite positions while moving.

---

## 5) Keyboard controls (main.py + Snake methods)
In main.py:
- screen.listen()
- screen.onkey(snake.up, "Up")
- screen.onkey(snake.down, "Down")
- screen.onkey(snake.left, "Left")
- screen.onkey(snake.right, "Right")

In snake.py:
- up/down/left/right methods change the head direction using setheading()

Safety rule added:
- Snake cannot reverse directly:
  - if heading is DOWN, cannot go UP (and vice versa)
  - if heading is RIGHT, cannot go LEFT (and vice versa)

Key takeaway:
- This prevents instant self-collision type moves and matches real snake game behavior.

## Notes from task.py (project breakdown)
- Step 1: Create snake body using square turtle segments
- Step 2: Move the snake forward by fixed distance repeatedly
- Step 3: Control snake direction using arrow keys (onkey handlers)

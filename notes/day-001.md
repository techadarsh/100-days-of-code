# Day 001 Notes

## Path
- day-001

## Concepts
- Printing (`print()`)
- Inputs (`input()`)
- String manipulation (basic)
- Variables
- String length using `len()`
- Variable naming (readability rule)
- Writing readable code (Rule 1)

## Key terms
- `print()`
- `input()`
- `len()`
- Comments: `# ...`
- String
- Variable

## Practice (what I did)
- Printed "Hello World!"
- Printed multiple lines using multiple `print()` statements
- Wrote step-by-step output for an exercise using `print()`
- Used `len()` to find the length of a string
- Took user input using `input()`

## Notes / Reminders
- `input()` always returns a string (text).
- To add notes in code, use comments:
  - Example: `# this is a comment`
- `len()` is used to get the length of a string:
  - Example: `len("Ayush")` returns `5`
- Variable naming:
  - Use meaningful names to keep code readable (Rule 1)

## Errors (common)
- **SyntaxError**
  - When Python syntax/grammar is wrong.
- **IndentationError**
  - When spaces/tabs are not correct (wrong indentation).
- **NameError**
  - When you use a variable name that is not defined.

## Summary
Today I learned basic Python printing, taking input, working with variables, and finding string length using `len()`. I also noted common beginner errors like SyntaxError, IndentationError, and NameError.

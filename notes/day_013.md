# Day 013 Notes

## Topic: Debugging in Python (Practical)

Today I practiced different debugging techniques and fixed small bugs using a step-by-step approach.

---

## 1) Describe the Problem
File:
- day-013/Describe the Problem/task.py

What I learned:
- Before changing code, clearly explain:
  - What the loop/function is supposed to do
  - When the output should happen
  - What you assume about variable values

Bug I fixed:
- `range(1, 21)` goes from 1 to 20, so the print should happen when `i == 20`.

---

## 2) Play Computer (Dry-run)
File:
- day-013/Play Computer/task.py

What I learned:
- Run the code in your head line-by-line like the computer.
- This helps find logic boundary issues (edge cases).

Case:
- Year `1994` was not being classified correctly because of condition boundaries.
- Fix is usually adjusting `<=` / `<` logic (inclusive vs exclusive).

---

## 3) Use Print (print() is your friend)
File:
- day-013/Use Print/task.py

What I learned:
- Use print statements to reveal intermediate values.
- If there is no output, first confirm:
  - inputs are being taken
  - calculations are happening
  - variables hold expected values

Exercise:
- Calculated total words:
  - total_words = pages * word_per_page
  - then printed it

---

## 4) Fix the Errors (Editor errors + try/except)
File:
- day-013/Fix the Errors/task.py

What I learned:
- Fix red underline errors first (they break execution).
- Use try/except to handle user input mistakes.

Used:
- try converting input to int
- except ValueError -> show a message and ask again
- then continued program normally

---

## 5) Use a Debugger (PyCharm)
Files:
- day-013/Use a Debugger/task.py
- day-013/Use a Debugger/maths.py

What I learned:
- Debugger helps inspect variables without adding many prints.
Key debugger actions:
- Breakpoints
- Step Over
- Step Into
- Step Into My Code

Exercise:
- Tracked variable changes inside a function that mutates a list using:
  - random.randint(...)
  - maths.add(...)

"""
A dictionary in Python functions similarly to a dictionary in real life. It's a data structure that allows us to associate a key to a value and pair the two pieces of data together.

This is how you create a dictionary in Python:

# An example dictionary
colours = {
    "apple": "red",
    "pear": "green",
    "banana": "yellow"
}

This is how you retrieve items from a dictionary:

print(colours["pear"])
#Will print "green"
This is how to create an empty dictionary:

my_empty_dictionary = {}
This is how you can add new items to an existing dictionary:

colours["peach"] = "pink"
This is also how you can edit an existing value in a dictionary:

colours["apple"] = "green"
This is how to loop through a dictionary and print all the keys:

for key in colours:
    print(key)
This is how to loop through a dictionary and print all the values:

for key in colours:
    print(colours[key])

# Loop through a dictionary

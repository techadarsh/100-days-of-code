"""
You are going to build an encryption and decryption program using the Caesar cipher.

Demo
https://appbrewery.github.io/python-day8-demo/

TODO-1:
Create a function called encrypt() that takes original_text and shift_amount as 2 inputs.

TODO-2:
Inside the 'encrypt' function, shift each letter of the original_text forwards in the alphabet by the shift_amount and print the encrypted text.

You can use the built-in Python index() function to find out the position of an item in a list. e.g.

fruits = ["Apple", "Pear", "Orange"]
fruits.index("Pear") #1
e.g. If we have following values:

plain_text = "hello"
shift_amount = 1
The final encrypted output should be:

Here is the encoded result: ifmmp

Where each of the letters of 'hello' is shifted up by 1.

 Hint 1
Let's breakdown the problem:
You need a for loop to loop through each of the letters in the plain_text.
Find the position of each letter in the alphabet List
Add the user desired shift_amount to the position to get the position of the encoded letter.
Find the corresponding letter for that position.
Add each encoded letter to a new string and print it out after the loop ends.
TODO-3:
Call the encrypt() function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message.

TODO-4:
What happens if you try to shift the letter 'z' forwards by 9? Can you fix the code?

 Hint 2
There are many approaches to do this. 1. You can add more than 1 set of the alphabet into the List of alphabet letters. 2. You can shift the shift_amount so that it is always within 0 - 25 and fits in the List. 3. You can use the modulo to get the remainder.

alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u',
            'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']

direction = input("Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:\n").lower()
text = input("Type your message:\n").lower()
shift = int(input("Type the shift number:\n"))

    for letter in original_text:
        if letter in alphabet:
            # TODO-4: What happens if you try to shift z forwards by 9? Can you fix the code?
            final_shift = (alphabet.index(letter) + shift_amount) % len(alphabet)
            encode_letter += alphabet[final_shift]
        else:
            encode_letter += letter
    print(encode_letter)

#  message.
